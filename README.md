# bloomers

A command-line spell checker implemented using Bloom filters. It builds a Bloom filter from a dictionary file and checks if provided words are likely spelled correctly.

## Usage

After building, run the executable with a dictionary file:

```sh
./bloomers -f dictionary.txt word1 word2 word3
```

This will output which words are likely misspelled.
